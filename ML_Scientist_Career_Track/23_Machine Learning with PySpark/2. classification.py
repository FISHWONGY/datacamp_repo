### Removing columns and rows
You previously loaded airline flight data from a CSV file. You're going to develop a model which will predict whether or not a given flight will be delayed.

In this exercise you need to trim those data down by:

1. removing an uninformative column and
2. removing rows which do not have information about whether or not a flight was delayed.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) considers a flight to be "delayed" when it arrives 15 minutes or more after its scheduled time.

1. convert the units of distance, replacing the `mile` column with a `kmcolumn`; and
2. create a Boolean column indicating whether or not a flight was delayed.

### Train/test split
To objectively assess a Machine Learning model you need to be able to test it on an independent set of data. You can't use the same data that you used to train the model: of course the model will perform (relatively) well on those data!

You will split the data into two components:

- True Negatives (TN) ??? model predicts negative outcome & known outcome is negative
- True Positives (TP) ??? model predicts positive outcome & known outcome is positive
- False Negatives (FN) ??? model predicts negative outcome but known outcome is positive

Accuracy is generally not a very reliable metric because it can be biased by the most common target class.

There are two other useful metrics:

- precision and

Precision is the proportion of positive predictions which are correct. For all flights which are predicted to be delayed, what proportion is actually delayed?

Recall is the proportion of positives outcomes which are correctly predicted. For all delayed flights, what proportion is correctly predicted by the model?

The precision and recall are generally formulated in terms of the positive target class. But it's also possible to calculate weighted versions of these metrics which look at both target classes.
